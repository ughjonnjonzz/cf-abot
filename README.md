# ABOT: An aBundance of Tables
_a simple D&D 5e character-building module for Foundry VTT, by CelestialFirestorm_

Need to build a character in a hurry? Need a kickstart to the creative process? Just want to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks?
Have I got the module for you!

Contained in this tidy little package are twelve (yes, a full dozen!) functional rolling tables for choosing everything from mechanically-important options [Race+Subrace, Class+Subclass, Backgrounds, Feats] to flavorful personality details a lively character simply can't do without [assigned gender, gender identity+pronouns, romantic & sexual orientation, alignment]!
