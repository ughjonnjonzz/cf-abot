# ABOT: An aBundance of Tables
_a simple D&D 5e character-building module for Foundry VTT, by CelestialFirestorm_

Need to build a character in a hurry? Need a kickstart to the creative process? Just want to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks?
Have I got the module for you!

Contained in this tidy little package are 30+ (yes, over _thirty_) functional rolling tables for choosing everything from mechanically-important options:
  - Race (1) + Subrace (9)
  - Class (1) + Subclass (13)
  - Background (1)
  - Feats (1)

to flavorful personality details a lively character simply can't do without!
  - assigned gender (1)
  - gender identity (1)
  - romantic (1) & sexual (1) orientation
  - alignment (1)

# Installation & Use
`https://github.com/ughjonnjonzz/cf-abot/blob/main/module.json`

All of the tables included in ABOT can be rolled with directly from the Compendium folders, or imported to the RollTables tab for easier access.

There are three Compendiums in ABOT: Mechanical Choices, Sub Info, and Personality Choices. The Sub Info Compendium contains all the tables for Subraces and Subclasses that are called by the Race and Class tables, respectively. This is for ease of importing the main Mechanical tables, if you only want those. But the Subrace and Subclass tables are also totally functional tables, so if you need to roll for something specific (i.e. you know your class but can't decide on a subclass), you can dig out the Sub table you need and roll on it, too!

# Dependencies
None! There is absolutely no coding involved with the function of this module -- just plug it in, turn it on, and you're ready to roll!

Though I would be remiss to not mention Plutonium. You don't need it to run ABOT, but ABOT certainly wouldn't exist without its help in automating a lot of the table-making process. Highly recommended!

# Conflicts
I honestly can't forsee any conflicts with something as simple as ABOT. It doesn't alter or modify any part of Foundry's functionality, only makes use of the existing RollTable and Compendium features. So I guess if there are modules that tweak either of those, it _might_ cause some funky things in ABOT's tables?

I also can't speak to any previous or upcoming versions of Foundry itself. I've only used v10, so if prior or future versions handle RollTable or Compendium differently than v10, ABOT might not work for them.

Guess I should also mention that these tables are specifically for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Will the tables function and roll within worlds using other systems? Sure. But the information gathered from them would be entirely useless, so I don't see why you would bother.

# The Tables
Everything from this point will be talking about the actual content of the tables themselves. I won't list the entire selection of Races, Backgrounds, or Feats for both space-saving and sanity reasons -- you'll just have to install the module to read those yourself ;)

## Mechanical Choices
Despite being far more important to the actual _game_, I've personally found dealing with these choices to be much easier; both in picking them for my own characters, and in building these tables. They're very objective, while personality choices are fluid and changeable. But I'll get into that more in that section.

### Race + Subrace
Most Races are pretty straightforward, where the abilities you get are set. But some are more complicated, with subraces or racial traits you have to choose from the get-go.

| Core Race | Subrace(s) |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Dragonborn | Base; Chromatic; Draconblood; Gem; Metallic; Ravenite |
| Dwarf | Duergar; Hill; Mark of Warding; Mountain |
| Elf* | Drow; High; Mark of Shadow; Pallid; Wood |
| Genasi | Air; Earth; Fire; Water |
| Gnome* | Forest; Mark of Scribing; Rock |
| Half-Elf | Base; Aquatic Elf Descent; Drow Descent; Mark of Detection; Mark of Storm; Moon Elf or Sun Elf Descent; Wood Elf Descent |
| Half-Orc | Base; Mark of Finding |
| Halfling | Ghostwise; Lightfoot; Lotusden; Mark of Healing; Mark of Hospitality; Stout |
| Human | Base; Mark of Handling; Mark of Making; Mark of Passage; Mark of Sentinel; Variant; Variant, Mark of Finding |
| Tiefling | Base; Asmodeus; Baalzebul; Dispater; Fierna; Glasya; Levistus; Mammon; Mephistopheles; Variant, Devil's Tongue; Variant, Hellfire; Variant, Infernal Legacy; Variant, Winged; Zariel |

\*Certain subraces of Elves (Astral, Kalashtar, Sea, Shadar-Kai, Triton) and Gnomes (Autognome, Deep) are listed as separate entities.

And then there are Aasimar and Shifters. Depending on which source material you use, the different forms of those two Races might be listed as subraces instead of racial traits. For the record, any race that has been printed more than once, I ran with the latest printing, which in most cases means Mordenkaiden Presents Monsters of the Multiverse. And MPMM does _not_ have the Aasimar and Shifter options listed as subraces, so I didn't include them in the subrace category.
